# CSharp theory

C# is a strongly typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method declaration specifies a name, the type and kind (value, reference, or output) for each input parameter and for the return value. The .NET class library defines built-in numeric types and complex types that represent a wide variety of constructs. These include the file system, network connections, collections and arrays of objects, and dates. A typical C# program uses types from the class library and user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.
